mkinitfs.sh - generate Linux initramfs for booting non-LUKS
cryptovolumes

I didn't find any initramfs generators to allow booting GNU/Linux
system from non-LUKS volume with custom cipher/keysize/hash parameters.
Hence I wrote my own one that:
 * installs sufficient set of kernel modules, statically-linked
   busybox, lvm and cryptsetup into initramfs archive
 * adds /init script that:
   * loads small set of kernel modules
   * takes names of encrypted volumes from kernel cmdline
   * takes custom cipher/keysize/hash parameters
   * decrypts cryptvols, searches for root volume, mounts it,
     does switch_root and passes control to /sbin/init
   * optionally mounts /usr partition before passing control
     to /sbin/init
