mkinitfs.sh - generate Linux initramfs for booting non-LUKS
cryptovolumes

I didn't find any initramfs generators to allow booting GNU/Linux
system from non-LUKS volume with custom cipher/keysize/hash parameters.
Hence I wrote my own one that:
 * installs sufficient set of kernel modules, statically-linked
   busybox, lvm and cryptsetup into initramfs archive
 * generates modules dependency files (modules.dep etc) and checks that
   there are no unresolved dependencies/symbols in the installed set of
   kernel modules
 * adds /init script that:
   * loads small set of kernel modules
   * takes names of encrypted volumes from kernel cmdline
   * takes custom cipher/keysize/hash parameters
   * decrypts encrypted volumes (in the exact order they are specified
     on the commandline)
   * patches i915 VBIOS using 915resolution if it's available and
     915resolution=<mode>:<W>x<H> option is passed on cmdline
   * searches for "hibernate resume" volume and attempts resuming
   * searches for root volume, mounts it, does switch_root and passes
     control to /sbin/init
   * optionally mounts /usr partition before passing control
     to /sbin/init

915resolution

mkinitfs uses 915resolution (http://915resolution.mango-lang.org/) to
patch i915 VBIOS _before_ initiating resuming from hibernate. If you
suspend with patched VBIOS and resume with unpatched, Xorg will crash:
